	 * What a ROM looks like to the file cache: one of the mimetypes the app
	 * registers, or -- for files uploaded before the app was installed and
	 * never run through occ maintenance:mimetype:update-db -- a name ending
	 * in one of the extensions those mimetypes are registered for. Either
	 * way it is the extension that decides above, so nothing shows up or
	 * goes missing over what the mimetype column happens to say.
	 *
	 * The system a game belongs to is not asked of the database: the
	 * arcade-system metadata is indexed and the search interfaces do take
	 * metadata comparisons, but it is only written once a file has been
	 * through the metadata events, so games uploaded before the app -- the
	 * very ones the extension clauses are here for -- would vanish from a
	 * filtered page. The scan is cached whole and filtered in PHP instead.
	 *
	 * @param array<string, string> $extensionMap extension => system id
