 * again.
 *
 * Older versions kept the games registry in a games.json next to the states,
 * filed states under the hash of the ROM's path (and before that flat in the
 * shared states folder, under the hash of user and path), kept saves-folder
 * saves without the system segment, and kept the play records and favorites
 * as JSON blobs of the user config. Each of those is converted here.
 *
 * The step is idempotent: everything is checked before it is touched, so a
 * partial earlier run only leaves less to do. Nothing that cannot be
 * converted is ever deleted or overwritten -- it stays exactly where it is.
