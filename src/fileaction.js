 * A "Play with Arcade" entry in the file menu.

 * The Viewer only ever matches a mimetype, so it cannot offer a game whose
 * mimetype Nextcloud has not been taught yet, and it cannot offer a zipped
 * one at all -- a .zip says nothing about what is inside. A file action is
 * handed the whole node, so it can go by the extension, and by the folder
 * the game sits in, the way the Arcade page does.
 *
 * It is added to `window._nc_fileactions` by hand rather than through
 * `registerFileAction` from `@nextcloud/files`: importing that package costs
 * a quarter of a megabyte on every page of the Files app, and this entry is
 * a few lines. The list is not a public API, so everything here is
 * best-effort: if Nextcloud ever stops reading plain objects from it, the
 * entry quietly does not appear, and nothing else is affected.
